The online sales segment has been experiencing rapid growth, with an increasing number of parents turning to e-commerce platforms for purchasing toddler footwear. This shift is largely due to the convenience, wider product selections, and competitive pricing available online. Additionally, online shopping enables consumers to access detailed product information, reviews, and recommendations, which aids in the decision-making process. The expansion of e-commerce giants and local online platforms in the Asia-Pacific region further fuels this trend, offering parents easy access to a variety of brands and styles from the comfort of their homes.
