Additionally, these policies may include coverage for environmental damage resulting from accidents like oil spills or other hazardous spills that could impact marine ecosystems.

Compulsory insurance for passenger ships ensures that ship owners meet their financial obligations in the event of a disaster, such as an accident resulting in passenger fatalities or injuries. As a result, the insurance industry is witnessing an evolution in its offerings, with a focus on more tailored and robust coverage options that can accommodate the complex needs of modern passenger shipping operations. This growth is fueled by rising consumer confidence in maritime safety, which has led to greater investments in both domestic and international passenger maritime routes.</p><h3>Cargo Ship</h3><p>The cargo ship subsegment of the Asia–Pacific Compulsory Maritime Insurance Market represents one of the most vital sectors of the maritime industry due to the essential role cargo ships play in transporting goods across international waters.
