This has been fueled by rising awareness about reproductive health and increasing access to home testing kits. Technological advancements have led to the development of more user-friendly, accurate, and sensitive pregnancy test meters, further boosting their adoption. Households benefit from these innovations as they offer convenience and efficiency, allowing individuals to test at their own pace. These home testing solutions provide easy-to-read results with minimal complexity, making them a popular choice for women across the Asia-Pacific region who want immediate confirmation of pregnancy before seeking medical advice or care. Additionally, increasing disposable income and growing self-care trends are contributing to the market's expansion in this segment.</p><h3>Hospitals</h3><p>In hospitals, pregnancy test meters are integral tools used by healthcare professionals for confirming pregnancy in patients. These tests offer reliable and accurate results, often used as an initial screening step before further clinical assessments are conducted. The hospital segment has grown due to the expanding healthcare infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region, with an increasing number of hospitals and clinics integrating advanced diagnostic equipment into their services.
